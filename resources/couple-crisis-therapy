          <p>
            Relationships don’t fall apart overnight. They crack slowly. Sometimes quietly. Sometimes with noise. And
            when a crisis finally shows up, it can feel like the whole ground is slipping from under your feet.
          </p>

          <p>
            I see this often in my sessions. Couples walk in exhausted, overwhelmed, frustrated, or scared. And many of
            them think the only job in that moment is to “stop the fighting.” But the real work is deeper. And more
            meaningful.
          </p>

          <p>
            This piece is my way of sharing what I’ve seen, learned, and practiced over the years while helping couples
            in the middle of a relationship storm.
          </p>

          <!-- SECTION 1 -->
          <h2 id="crisis-stabilisation">How Couples Can Stabilise a Crisis (especially in the Indian context)</h2>

          <p>
            When emotions run high, clarity disappears. So the very first step is not solving the problem. It’s pausing
            the fire.
          </p>

          <h3 id="time-out">1. The Time-Out and Re-engagement Method</h3>

          <p>
            This is simple, but it works beautifully if both partners follow it honestly.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Create a Pause Signal.</strong><br>
            Choose a word or gesture that means “Stop. Let’s not make this worse.” Something neutral. Something both of
            you agree to beforehand. The moment it’s used, the argument stops. No questions asked.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Separate for a short while.</strong><br>
            Not to punish each other. Not to run away. Just to breathe. Walking around the block, listening to calming
            music, sitting quietly, writing down what you’re feeling… anything that brings your body back to normal.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Come back at a fixed time.</strong><br>
            Pick a slot. “We’ll talk again at 9 PM.” And stick to it. The goal is to show that taking space is not the
            same as avoidance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Couples who practice this consistently see a sharp drop in explosive fights within a few weeks.
          </p>

          <h3 id="i-statements">2. Using “I feel…” instead of “You always…”</h3>

          <p>
            Blame shuts people down. Vulnerability pulls people closer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of:<br>
            <em>“You never support me with your parents.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            Try:<br>
            <em>“I feel alone and overwhelmed when I have to manage everything with the family. I need us to talk about
              sharing that responsibility.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            And if you’re the listener, your only job is to reflect what you heard:
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>“So you’re feeling overwhelmed and want me to step in more. Did I get that right?”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            This small shift can change the emotional temperature in seconds.
          </p>

          <h3 id="couple-bubble">3. Protecting Your Relationship from Outside Pressure</h3>

          <p>
            Indian couples don’t just deal with each other. They deal with parents, siblings, relatives, opinions,
            expectations, and sometimes even community dynamics.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a relationship is in crisis, you need a temporary “Couple Bubble.”
          </p>

          <p>
            A simple shared line works wonders:<br>
            <em>“We’re handling things together and we need a little space right now.”</em>
          </p>

          <p>
            It sounds polite. It’s firm. And it keeps outside influences from adding more stress to a fragile moment.
          </p>

          <!-- SECTION 2 -->
          <h2 id="crisis-types">Common Crises I Help Couples Navigate</h2>

          <p>
            Every crisis has layers, but here are the ones I see most often—and what therapy focuses on.
          </p>

          <h3 id="infidelity">1. Infidelity or Betrayal</h3>

          <p>
            In India, affairs are wrapped in secrecy and shame. Both partners often feel isolated. Therapy helps contain
            the emotional shock, process the hurt, and slowly rebuild communication without moral judgment.
          </p>

          <h3 id="communication-collapse">2. Communication Collapse</h3>

          <p>
            This often comes from years of not expressing emotions or being punished for doing so. Many men especially
            were never taught to talk about feelings. Therapy helps build emotional vocabulary and break harmful
            communication patterns.
          </p>

          <h3 id="joint-family">3. Joint Family Conflicts</h3>

          <p>
            In-law issues, privacy concerns, unfair expectations, financial involvement—these problems are extremely
            common. I help couples build healthy boundaries and operate as a team instead of two individuals reacting
            to the world.
          </p>

          <h3 id="life-transitions">4. Life Transitions and Mismatched Expectations</h3>

          <p>
            Marriage after an arranged setup, career shifts, parenting, relocation—these life changes can shake the
            foundation of a relationship. Therapy helps couples build a shared vision instead of two competing ones.
          </p>

          <h3 id="mental-health">5. Addiction or Mental Health Challenges</h3>

          <p>
            When one partner is struggling with depression, anxiety, or substance use, the relationship carries the
            weight. Therapy supports both partners—one through treatment, the other through understanding and
            boundaries.
          </p>

          <!-- SECTION 3 -->
          <h2 id="why-crisis-only">Why Crisis-Only Therapy Doesn’t Work</h2>

          <p>
            I say this gently but with honesty: crisis-only therapy is like applying a bandage on a wound that keeps
            reopening.
          </p>

          <h3>1. The crisis isn’t the real problem</h3>

          <p>
            The fight you had is not the issue. The silence after the fight is not the issue. These are symptoms. The
            deeper issue is the pattern that keeps pulling both of you into the same emotional loop.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you don’t address the pattern, the crisis comes back. Sometimes louder.
          </p>

          <h3>2. The emotional injury underneath stays unresolved</h3>

          <p>
            Most couples fight on the surface: chores, phone usage, in-laws, finances.
          </p>

          <p>
            Underneath these fights are wounds like:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>“I don’t feel chosen.”</li>
            <li>“I don’t feel safe with you.”</li>
            <li>“I don’t feel important.”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Crisis management gives short-term peace. Attachment-focused therapy gives long-term healing.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Long-term skills make the relationship stronger</h3>

          <p>
            Healthy relationships need training. Just like muscles. Emotional regulation, conflict repair, gentle
            communication, appreciation routines—these are not skills we are born with. Therapy becomes a space to learn
            and practice them before the next storm hits.
          </p>

          <p>
            When couples learn maintenance skills, they stop coming to therapy only during emergencies. They come
            because they want to grow.
          </p>

          <!-- SECTION 4 -->
          <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

          <p>
            A crisis can break you or wake you. But it doesn’t decide the future of the relationship. What you do after
            the crisis does.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’re going through something difficult right now, please know this—many couples repair, reconnect, and
            rebuild after moments that once felt impossible.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want, I can help you with a simple step-by-step version of the Time-Out and Re-engagement method, or
            guide you on how to find the right couples therapist for your situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            You don’t have to figure it out alone.
